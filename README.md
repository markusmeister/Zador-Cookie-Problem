``UNSOLVED (i think) math problem.

The Cookie Monster is looking for a cookie placed on the real number line with Gaussian distribution centered at 0 (std=1). 
He only detects cookie on top of it

What is optimal search strategy, ie where does he turn around?

Solver gets a cookie''

It's all in the Jupyter notebook `Cookie-A.ipynb`.
